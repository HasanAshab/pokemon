here is my latest code. but now i want to change my stratagy of storing these data like this

/db/moves/ember.json
/db/moves/scratch.json
/db/moves/*.json (remaining moves in this format)
/db/moves/__all__.json (it contains a array of string, move names)

/db/pokemons/balbasaur.json
/db/pokemons/charmander.json
/db/pokemons/*.json (remaining pokemons in this format)
/db/moves/__all__.json (it contains a array of string, pokemon names)

/db/types.json (the only different here. store all serialized types in one file)
